>Consider the situation of an avid shopper, who often buys clothes for family, relatives, and close friends (both online and in person). This activity is fraught with difficulties, but one basic issue is keeping track of each person's dimensions. What is needed is a simple, attractive, intuitive, mobile app to manage this data. Let us call this app: SizeBook.

>For this app, focus on the dimensions needed to help size apparel worn on the main body (e.g., tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.) and not accessories (e.g., hats, shoes).

>The app should allow the user to:
>show a list of all records along with a count of the number of records, 
>add a new record (which always appends to the bottom end of the list), 
>view the details of an existing record, 
>edit the fields of a record, 
>delete an existing record.

>BasicStoryboard.pdf was used to originally plan out the layout for SizeBook
